# Solution to problems on Codeforces in C++ (in practice)
# Past contest solutions on Codeforces/Google kick start (in contest)
# Our Team "ONLY_FEEDBACK_IS_WA" came second in the 2020 ICPC South Pacific Regional Contest
# As the team coming first is also from UNSW, we could not go to world final
# Since I have graduated from UNSW, this is perhaps my last regional contest
# 2 years experiences of CP have taught me a lot and brought me a lot of joy
# I also got to know other great people who participates in CP
# Without doubt, CP has made my University life much much more fruitful and interesting
